## Release Notes

This is a slightly modified release of the original VS Code ChordPro extension.
With it comes syntax highlighting support for one of the best song lyrics and
chords format.
Now supports exporting batch chordpro files to OpenSong backup (OSB) format. You can navigate between songs separated by the {new_song} directive by pressing Ctrl-Shift-O.

Future releases will have, at some point in time, improvements in the
highlighting (add coloring by groups), and what's listed on the check list, in
the [Features](#Features) section.
